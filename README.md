# 🛡️ TryHackMe Writeups

Welcome to my collection of **TryHackMe** writeups!  
This repository contains notes, walkthroughs, and solutions to rooms I’ve completed on TryHackMe.

## 📂 Structure

Each folder represents a room, named after the THM room itself. Inside each folder, you’ll find:
- A detailed writeup (usually in `README.md`)
- Screenshots or code snippets (if needed)
- Exploitation steps and tools used

## 📣 Disclaimer

These writeups are my personal notes meant for learning and sharing knowledge.  
**Do not use this information to attack systems you do not own or have permission to test.**
